# nodejs-typescript
Nodejs with TypeScript template IntelliJ IDEA project with working stacktraces/debugging on save/relative path resolution.
Two modes/run configs:
- transpile on save/build - everything works
- transpile on the fly - (via bootstrap.js, uses ts-node register) debugging isn't working properly with it
